The internet is a series of computers connected to a network that can move data from
one place to another. When data travels from place to place, it is broken up into packets
and then the browser collects all the packets in order and displays the page.

When a user clicks on a link, the browser starts a DNS address look up to a DNS server,
whether it's the local dns cache, local router dns, isp dns, root dns servers. It takes the
domain name and finds the matching IP address to it. Once it's found, the IP address is then
sent back to the browser and it requests a connection to the web page server.
